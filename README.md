## Lebanon Airbnb Clone GitHub Repo

This GitHub repo contains the code for a Lebanon Airbnb clone, which is a front-end app using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, and a back-end app using Java Spring Boot and MySQL.

**Front-end app:**

The front-end app is responsible for displaying the user interface and handling user interactions. It uses Next.js to provide server-side rendering and static site generation, React to create the user interface, and Tailwind CSS to style the user interface.

The front-end app communicates with the back-end app through a REST API. The front-end app uses the REST API to fetch and submit data, such as accommodation listings, bookings, and user information.

**Back-end app:**

The back-end app is responsible for storing and managing data, and processing business logic. It uses Java Spring Boot to provide a lightweight and efficient web framework, and MySQL to store data in a relational database.

The back-end app exposes a REST API that the front-end app uses to fetch and submit data. The back-end app also handles tasks such as authentication, authorization, and payment processing.

## Getting started

To get started with the Lebanon Airbnb clone GitHub repo, you will need to:

1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
